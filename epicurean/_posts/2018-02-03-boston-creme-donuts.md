As a lover of donuts, I've always feared making them (mostly because I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to yeast and rolling dough). This recipe wasn't so bad! I think the trickiest part was keeping the oil at a consistent temperature and finding the right time to flip each donut to get that perfect golden color.

Also, I didn't have a great idea of how much filling was too much filling. The real test was to see if filling sputtered back out. Some of the donuts were real (filling) bombs, but nobody seemed to complain. Filling donuts is an art form.

This concludes my baking bucket list series (for now).
