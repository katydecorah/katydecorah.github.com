This has become one of our favorite Instant Pot recipes. It's especially perfect for fall. It also holds up great for leftovers or meal prep.

I did a thing in this recipe that I don't love: where an ingredient needs its own recipe (re: 2 lbs roasted or grilled chicken breast, cubed). If it helps, once I have the Instant Pot running for its 30 minutes, I'll season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and throw them on the grill.

Now I'm doing a thing with this recipe that I don't love: long intros when all you want is the recipe. K byeeee.

## Ingredients

- 1¬†cup chopped onion
- 5 garlic cloves, pressed or minced
- 2 Tbsp¬†ginger root, minced, peeled, divided
- 2 cups¬†uncooked long grain brown rice or long-grain basmati
- 2 pounds sweet potato or butternut squash, peeled and sliced into ¬Ω-inch cubes
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 4 cups (32 oz) vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
- 2 large bunches of kale (about 2 pounds), stemmed and chopped
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- Red pepper flakes (optional), to taste
- 2 lbs roasted or grilled chicken breast, cubed (optional, but highly recommended)

## Instructions

1. Lightly coat inside of a 6-quart electric pressure cooker with cooking spray. Turn machine to saut√© setting; warm for a couple of minutes.
2. Add **onion**, **garlic**, 1 ¬Ω Tbsp **ginger**; cook, stirring often, until softened, 4 minutes. Stir in **rice** and **potato**; cook, stirring often, 1 minute. Add **curry powder**, and **salt** and **pepper** (to taste) until fragrant, 1 minute.
3. Add **broth**; stir well. Add all but ¬Ω cup **coconut milk**. Lay **kale** on top of mixture in cooker; press kale down without stirring it in (so rice grains stay submerged in broth below).
4. Lock lid onto pot; set machine to cook on high for 30 minutes.
5. Allow pressure to fall naturally for 10 minutes. Release any excess pressure through pressure valve and then open pot.
6. Remove the lid and turn the machine to the saut√© setting.
7. Add reserved ¬Ω Tbsp **ginger**, remaining **coconut milk**, **lime juice**, **red pepper flakes**, and **chicken**, and stir them with kale into rice mixture below. Stir until mixture is thickened.

## Time savers

- Dump frozen onions into the Instant Pot instead of cutting fresh. (I find Instant Pot recipes are pretty forgiving with frozen vegetables.) But also I really hate chopping onions.
- Use minced garlic and gingers from a jar. It may bring the flavor down a couple notches, but still gets the job done.
