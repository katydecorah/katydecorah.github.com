- Shower and change your clothes frequently (or daily even)
- Your significant other (who also works from home) isn't your coworker &mdash; respect their time.
- Leave the house (even if it's to aimlessly walk around Jo-Ann Fabrics).
- Don't do house chores during work hours (because you'll never remember to fold the laundry).
- Don't do work hours during downtime (because you'll never stop working).
- Have a _special_ lunch at least once a week (order out, grill a hotdog).
- Hang out with your friends.
- Ping your coworkers just to say, _Hey!_
- Build a tabletop for the treadmill and walk 5 miles every morning[^1]:
