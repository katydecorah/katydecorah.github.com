I found an old note that contained a project to write a haiku every day. My project started in December 2018 and ended promptly in January 2019. The themes included work, baking, and difficulty finding nice fabric.

```haiku
Meal prepped our lunch
Ginger lemon tea downtown
Cookies and treadmill
```

```haiku
Dutch baby, no pouf
Crispy, sweet, and delightful
Topped with bananas
```

```haiku
Force push to staging
Bump. Install. Serve. Click. Approve.
Pull request review.
```

```haiku
Manometry shows
Incomplete bolus clearance
Rheumatic perhaps
```

```haiku
New year and work day
I open a new window
And another tab
```

```haiku
A mountain of clothes
I ask does it bring me joy
An empty closet
```

```haiku
A tiny mess here
And there. I tidy up, but
Another mess there
```

```haiku
Parallelogram
I tried to cut from fabric
I cut a rhombus
```

```haiku
Whip to peaks just so
Fold until ribbons beware
Wrinkly, flat, chewy
```

```haiku
Garish and floral
Whimsical and outdated
I want good fabric
```

```haiku
Oatmeal with French toast
Sipping a piping hot chai
Body so warm, flushed
```

```haiku
Typing and trying
Searching and guessing, please work.
Jekyll was simpler
```

```haiku
A filling once filled
Is filled again; my smile crooked
My teeth sensitive
```

```haiku
Eight avocados
will become guacamole
thanks to bananas
```

```haiku
My nail tears too soon
impatient, slow connection
fighting time and flesh
```

```haiku
Two library cards
Two tacos and a brisket
One party; big smiles
```

```haiku
Listen to a call
and microwave soup for lunch
as I pump breast milk
```
