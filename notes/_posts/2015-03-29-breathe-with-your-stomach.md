A couple months ago, I was chewing on an idea for a slide for [my FOSS4GNA talk](/code/writing-for-everyone/) and I needed to write it out. Knowing that [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/) had opened their submissions, I worked on the idea and massaged it into something that I enjoyed.

I'm so honored and excited that they accepted my piece!
