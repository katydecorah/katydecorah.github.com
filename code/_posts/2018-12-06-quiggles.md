I built a Slack app called Quiggles that asks your workspace channel a question. Members can submit questions via a Slack command. It's great for ice breakers or to spark conversation. The best part is that it brings together a lot of my favorite tools:

- [Glitch](https://glitch.com) - holds all the code to make everything work.
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com) - stores the data for the questions.
- [Slack](https://slack.com) - where the discussion happens.
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com) - triggers the daily post by posting to webhook pointed at Glitch.

Check out the [README on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/quiggles?path=README.md:1:0) to learn how you can set up a Quiggles for your Slack channel.

## Under the hood

### Adding questions:

1. Members can use the Slack slash command `/quiggles place your question here` to submit questions. The code [write the question as a row in my Airtable base](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/quiggles?path=workers.js:11:0).
2. Upon successful addition of the question, the member receives [an ephemeral Slack message](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/quiggles?path=workers.js:75:0).

### Asking questions:

1. I created a Zapier zap that will run at 11 am every week day. It's action is to [POST to a webhook URL](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/quiggles?path=index.js:42:0) that's pointed at my Glitch project.
2. Once my Glitch project receives an authorized message from Zapier, my Glitch project will pull all the rows from my Airtable base and [select a random question](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/quiggles?path=workers.js:27:0) that hasn't been asked yet.
3. Next, the code [marks the selected question as asked](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/quiggles?path=workers.js:55:0) by updating the `date_asked` column.
4. Finally, it will [post the question in Slack](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/quiggles?path=workers.js:93:0).
