  description: >-
    Buttery and crisp, with an appealing texture from the cornmeal, these
    shortbread cookies are baked in a round tart or pie tin, then cut into
    wedges to resemble slim fans The lime juice in the glaze cuts the sweetness
    and echoes the zest in the dough (You can also use lemon, orange or
    grapefruit — or a combination instead of lime, if you prefer.) The cookies
    keep for up to two weeks when stored airtight at room temperature, and
    freeze very well.
