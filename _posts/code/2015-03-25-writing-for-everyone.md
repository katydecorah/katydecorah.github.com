A couple weeks ago I gave my talk [Writing for everyone]({{site.url}}/writing-for-everyone/) at FOSS4G NA. I had a great time! You can [click through my slides]({{site.url}}/writing-for-everyone/), follow along with [my notes]({{site.url}}/writing-for-everyone/notes/), or <a href="https://youtu.be/bXd6aRRvJG4?list=PLWW0CjV-TafaJlkE6Zq4OgXgb04TQfNiR" data-proofer-ignore>watch the video</a>.

The slides are built with [Big](http://www.macwright.org/big/) and Jekyll. At first I was just going to work in a flat HTML file, but then I got the itch.

Directories! Pages! Organization! Front-matter! Logic!

I wove Big into Jekyll and came up with a nice workflow. Each slide is a Jekyll post. I organized sections into folders. I used front matter properties to organize slide styles. Oh and that notes page up top? It's pulling each slide/posts `notes` data from the front matter. Pretty handy. [Check out the repo](https://github.com/katydecorah/writing-for-everyone).
