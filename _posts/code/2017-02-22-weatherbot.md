We live in Upstate New York so there's snow and it's kind of pain for J to plow the driveway if our cars are in the way. I built a little Slack bot that runs three times a day (7 am, 1 pm, and 7 pm). And if there will be more than one inch of snow in the next 12 hours then [WeatherBot](https://github.com/katydecorah/weatherbot) will ping our Slack:

## How it works

1. Using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/), I [run through the hourly data](https://github.com/katydecorah/weatherbot/blob/86235dc3d851af72b3ebce940943f3f49bc4bdd3/index.js#L29) for the next 12 hours.
2. During each hour, if there's precipitation and it's snow, *and* there is accumulation then [start adding up the accumulation](https://github.com/katydecorah/weatherbot/blob/86235dc3d851af72b3ebce940943f3f49bc4bdd3/index.js#L32-L34).
3. If there's more than 1 inch of snow during the next 12 hours, then [post to Slack](https://github.com/katydecorah/weatherbot/blob/86235dc3d851af72b3ebce940943f3f49bc4bdd3/index.js#L41-L47).

## How it runs

WeatherBot uses three [AWS resources](https://aws.amazon.com/):

1. [**S3**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - I deploy and host the code here.
2. [**Cloudformation**](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) - I created a [Cloudformation template](https://github.com/katydecorah/weatherbot/blob/master/cloudformation/weatherbot.template.json) that defines the variables and the functions that Lambda will need to run my code.
3. [**Lambda**](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) - Lambda is responsible for [running my code](https://github.com/katydecorah/weatherbot/blob/master/cloudformation/weatherbot.template.json#L113-L126) at the days and times I've defined. (The Cloudformation template does me a solid by configuring Lambda for me.)

And now we get to sit back and wait for :snowflake: and then park our cars good.
