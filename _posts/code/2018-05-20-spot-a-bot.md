I love automating processes and creating bots (whether they are useful or just fun). Here are some of my tips to identify if it's time to create a bot to help with your workflow.

## Recipe for a good bot

You'll know if you have a candidate for a bot if you have: a frequent manual process, consistent data, and a schedule or action for the trigger.

### 1. Frequent manual process

> “Every week I update a GitHub ticket with data from a Google Spreadsheet.”

> “Every day I need to know how many people are going to be in the office, including visitors.”

> “I need to know who at the company has anniversary next month and how many years so we can order them a personalized cake.”

### 2. Consistent data

Having a consistent data source can really make or break your process. Check to see that your data:

- Lives on an application or service that has an API
- Has hooks or identifiers that will allow us to filter out the data we want

### 3. Schedule or action

You bot could run on a schedule:

- Every 5 minutes
- The first Monday of the month
- Every day at 5:30 pm Pacific Time
- When an event is triggered

Or it could be based on a trigger.....

## Should I build it custom?

There are a lot of services like [Zapier](#) and [IFTTT](#) that can make automation as easy as connecting your account and clicking a few buttons. There are also a lot of built in features in [Slack](#).

I recommend seeing if services can already do the automation you're looking for before creating a completely custom bot from the ground up.

Create a custom bot when a service doesn't connect the processes you need or in a way that you need them to or you have any privacy concerns.

## Is my bot helpful?

- Consider if your bot will add value or noise
- The bot should fit into our workflows not the other way around
- Your bot is always a work in progress
