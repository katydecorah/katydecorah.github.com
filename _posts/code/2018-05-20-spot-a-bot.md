I love automating processes and creating bots (whether they are useful or just fun). I'd like to share some of my tips for spotting a good candidate for a future bot and some tips along the way.

## Recipe for a good bot

You'll know if you have a candidate for a bot if you have: a frequent manual process, consistent data, and a schedule or action for the trigger.

### 1. Frequent manual process

> “Every week I update a GitHub ticket with data from a Google Spreadsheet.”

> “Every day I need to know how many people are going to be in the office, including sprinters.”

> “I need to know who at the company has anniversary next month and how many years so we can order them a personalized cake.”

### 2. Consistent data

- Data lives on an application that has an API
- Data lives on a GitHub issue with consistent formatting
- Data has hooks to know what data we want

### 3. Schedule or action

You bot could run on a schedule:
- Every 5 minutes
- The first Monday of the month
- Every day at 5:30 pm Pacific Time
- When an event is triggered

Or it could be based on a trigger.....

## Should I build it custom?

There are a lot of services like [Zapier](#) and [IFTTT](#) that can make automation as easy as connecting your account and clicking a few buttons. There are also a lot of built in features in [Slack](#).

I recommend seeing if services can already do the automation you're looking for before creating a completely custom bot from the ground up.

Create a custom bot when a service doesn't connect the processes you need or in a way that you need them to or you have any privacy concerns.


## Is your bot helpful or does it add noise?

- Consider if your bot will add value or noise
- The bot should fit into our workflows not the other way around
- Your bot is always a work in progress
